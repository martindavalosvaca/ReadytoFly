                        Wondering if ReadytoFly will work for you?

                        Research shows that participants experience measurable anxiety reduction within 7 days of daily practice, with most achieving significant improvement by session 4. Virtual exposure combined with acceptance strategies has been proven as effective as real-world exposure in multiple controlled trials.
