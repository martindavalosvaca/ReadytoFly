                                What is CBT?

<div class="faq__answer">
<div class="faq__answer-content">
                                    Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a scientifically proven psychological treatment that helps you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors. For flight anxiety, CBT helps you recognize irrational fears, challenge catastrophic thinking, and develop healthier coping strategies. It's been shown to have an 80-95% success rate for specific phobias.
